### Time Savers Toolbar

This extension adds a new toolbar that adds command buttons for most *Time Savers* features giving you a
**one-click experience**, saving you from having to go hunting for the command you want in a menu somewhere.

To enable the toolbar, right-click in a blank spot on the toolbar area, and select *Time Savers*.
Like all other Visual Studio toolbars, you can remove any commands that you feel you don't need,
or even add existing Visual Studio commands to it.

### Time Savers Menu

For people who prefer a menu to a toolbar this extension also adds a new menu to Visual Studio's main menu bar.
All *Time Savers* features are available via this menu giving you a simple
**two-click experience**.

### Context Menus (right-click)

For people who hate having to move their mouse from the code they're working on,
another menu has been added to the context menu of any code window, as well as to some nodes in *Solution Explorer*.
Most *Time Savers* features are available via this context menu for a simple
**right-click experience**, without having to your mouse from the code you're working on.

The commands have been grouped into their own *Time Savers* menu because most context menus
are already pretty clogged up. And they're growing all the time,
as Microsoft or 3rd-party extensions add more and more commands to them.

Unfortunately that means that there's one more click involved than I'd ideally prefer.
However I've found it much easier to find commands in a dedicated menu anyway, rather
than having to search through one gigantic menu of commands.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Some of the *Time Savers* features that tend to be used frequently have also been assigned a keyboard shortcut for a 
**one or two keystroke experience**.
And of course you can add your own keyboard shortcut to any of the *Time Savers* features.
